# STM32F103-Swimming-LCD
This updated C code appears to be a main program file targeting a microcontroller, likely an STM32 microcontroller. The code is intended to initialize and communicate with a 16x2 character LCD using the HD44780 driver library.

Let's go through the key components of the code:

The code includes various header files representing different libraries used in the project, including "main.h," "gpio.h," "HD44780LIB.h," and a custom "LCD16x2.h" header. These headers provide access to functions and constants required for the peripherals and libraries used in the application.

Main Function:
The main function is the entry point of the program. It initializes the microcontroller's peripherals, including the GPIOs, and then enters an infinite loop.

LCD Initialization and Display:
Within the infinite loop, the code initializes the 16x2 character LCD by calling LCD_Init() and then clears the LCD screen using LCD_Clear(). After that, it displays the string "hello im mas" on the LCD screen using the PStr function from the HD44780 driver library.

System Clock Configuration:
The SystemClock_Config function configures the system clock for the microcontroller. It uses the HSI (High-Speed Internal) oscillator as the clock source, sets the PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) to multiply the HSI by 16, and configures the clock dividers for the CPU, AHB, and APB buses.

It's important to note that the code may require additional configurations and initialization for other peripherals or features, depending on the specific hardware setup and the requirements of the project.

To use this code on GitHub, you can follow the same steps mentioned earlier to create a new repository and upload this C code as the main program file. Additionally, you can include a README.md file in your repository to provide more information about the project and how to use the code.
